# OCT-Classifictaion
Diabetic Macular Edema is the major cause of vision-loss in highly prevalent Type 2 diabetes. OCT imaging is widely used method that can help in early its identification and prevent vision loss. Analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time.

We developed a CNN based deep neural model with 98% accuracy to classify these images into following 4 types:

DME (occurs when excess fluid starts to build up in the macula of the eye)

Drusen (yellow deposits under the retina)

CNV (Choroidal neovascularization is the growth of abnormal blood vessels beneath the retina)

Normal
